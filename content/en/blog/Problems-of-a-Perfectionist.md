## Chapter One

### The trap of perfection

After over 30 years of walking the earth believing the problem was with everything else but me, I just recently found out most of the goal I never achieved were the direct result of a very big lie I've bin telling myself all my life, "_Perfection is the goal!_".
Looking back now, I even have a list of rules, that the first command of which reads like this: "_Do it, only if you can do it perfectly_", and oh boy! How long would be the list of the things I didn't do just because I might have not been able to do them perfectly. And how much have I avoided taking credit for my great accomplishments just because I thought they were not perfect enough.
