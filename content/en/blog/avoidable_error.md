## Confessions of a BioMed Tech: The “Oops” Moments That Keep Me Busy!

Ever seen a medical device suddenly act strange or shut down completely? As a biomedical engineering service technician, I’m the detective who shows up to figure out why. And the surprising truth is this:

A huge percentage of medical device “malfunctions” aren’t technical failures at all.
They’re small user errors that build up over time.

So let’s talk about the biggest culprits. Some are serious, some are funny, and all of them are strangely common. Meet the Top Gremlins of Medical Equipment:

⸻

### 1. Incorrect Cable Routing

Tight bends, pressure points, or strained cables slowly damage connectors and insulation.
Or as I like to call it…

The Cable Yanker 🏃‍♂️
Pulling cables like you’re starting a lawnmower leads straight to frayed wires and random failures.

⸻

### 2. Skipping Warm-Up or Self-Test Steps

Devices rely on initial calibration routines for accurate performance. Skipping them creates errors that look like hardware faults.

⸻

### 3. Misaligned or Unclean Sensors

A bit of gel, dust, or dried disinfectant on ECG electrodes, SpO₂ sensors, or ultrasound probes is enough to cause unreliable readings.

Or in gremlin form:

The “Creative” Cleaning Crew 🧪
Using the wrong spray or wiping sensors aggressively can leave residue, damage surfaces, or interfere with readings.

⸻

### 4. Ignoring Error Logs

Most devices warn long before anything actually breaks. But logs often get overlooked until the issue becomes critical.

⸻

### 5. Incorrect Accessory Combinations

Using non-approved accessories creates calibration mismatches, unstable measurements, and intermittent faults.

Or the fun version:

The “Hulk Smash” Connector 💪
Forcing incompatible or misaligned plugs bends pins, breaks ports, and creates mysterious intermittent failures.

⸻

**Bonus Gremlin: The Liquid Avenger ☕️**

Not officially on the engineering list, but definitely on the field list.
A spilled drink may be the most dramatic (and expensive) way to ruin a device. These machines are many things, but waterproof coffee mugs are not.

⸻

My job is to fix these issues, but my goal is to help prevent them. A little extra care goes a long way in keeping medical technology reliable for the patients who depend on it.
