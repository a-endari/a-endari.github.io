# Obsidian

## Let’s agree on one thing: Obsidian is easily one of the best choices you can make when it comes to note-taking apps.

Over the years, I’ve tried more note-taking apps than I can count — from good old Windows Notepad and Samsung Notes (back when it was still called S Note, I think!) all the way to Notion, MS Word, Apple Notes, and Pages. You name it, I’ve dabbled with it.

But in the end, only two apps have consistently pulled me back: Vim in the terminal and Obsidian.

In this blog series, I’ll first try to convince you why you should use Obsidian — and then I’ll show you how to turn it into your most powerful productivity weapon yet.

## Let’s start with the “Why”

Why not?

It’s free.
It’s Markdown-based.
It’s insanely flexible thanks to a huge collection of plugins.
And your notes? They’re just simple .md files — which means you’re in control.

Of course, there are many more reasons why Obsidian might be the perfect choice for you. (Said Yoda, probably.)

But hey, maybe you’re a Notion person — lost in infinite pages and toggles — and beyond redemption. 😄
