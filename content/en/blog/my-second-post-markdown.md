# Markdown

### A simple text file that looks good! We can kind of call it the html of plain text.

A title in markdown is simply shown by a single-pound sign followed by a single or multiple spaces -> # , and as you add to the number of _pound_-_signs_ (like ## or ###), you decrease the size of the title.

```markdown
# this would be <h1> title
## and this would be <h2> title
.
.
.
###### this then would be an equivalant of <h6>
```
### As for **Bold** or *italic* words:

two asterixes around words or phrases makes them "bold", and one asterix around them makes them <cite>"Italic [^3]"</cite>

[^3]: now all I say here will be shown as a foot note
