      <description>Hi there, welcome to my about me page. I&amp;rsquo;m glad you&amp;rsquo;re here, because I have a lot to say. Let me start by telling you a little bit about myself.
I was born in Iran in 1989, the same year as Taylor Swift and Daniel Radcliffe. I have a masters degree in biomedical engineering, which means I know a lot about how the human body works and how to design devices that can help people.</description>
