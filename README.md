## I needed a place to share my ideas with you ðŸ˜‰

One of the challenges of creating a blog is finding a suitable platform to host it. Many options are available, but some of them may not meet your needs or preferences. For example, "github pages" is a popular choice for hosting static sites, but it does not support dynamic features that some bloggers may want.

That's why I decided to use hugo, a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can generate static pages from markdown files. Hugo has a command-line interface that allows me to update my blog with minimal effort. All I have to do is write a new post in markdown and hugo takes care of the rest. It also has a variety of themes to choose from, and I am using the "**Blist**" theme for this blog.

This blog is still a work in progress, and I am enjoying the learning process and the creative freedom that hugo offers. I hope you find my posts interesting and informative.

Sincerely, A.E
